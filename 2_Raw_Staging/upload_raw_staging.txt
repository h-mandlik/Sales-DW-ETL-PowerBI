Raw Table Import Method
The raw.dataset table was created using SQL Server Management Studio's Import Flat File wizard.

Steps: 

1. Right-click database → Tasks → Import Flat File
2. Selected sales_data_sample.csv
3. Auto-generated raw.dataset with all columns as NVARCHAR(50) to allow NULLs
4. Data loaded directly into raw schema
