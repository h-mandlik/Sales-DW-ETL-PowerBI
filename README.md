## 📌 Problem Statement

The dataset provided is a single flat file containing sales records with inconsistent, unstructured, and dirty data — including missing values, incorrect formats, duplicate entries, and mixed text cases. This makes direct analysis unreliable and inefficient.

**Objective**:  
Build a reliable data pipeline to:
- Clean and structure raw sales data
- Model a star schema for analytical performance
- Enable business intelligence reporting and dashboards
- Support decision-making with accurate, timely insights

This project simulates real-world scenarios faced by data analysts and engineers in retail or e-commerce environments.

## 🛠️ Steps Followed

### 1. **Data Acquisition**
- Dataset sourced from Kaggle: [Sample Sales Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data)
- Single CSV file ingested into SQL Server using Import Wizard

### 2. **Database & Schema Design**
- Created database: `SalesDW`
- Implemented layered architecture:
  - `raw` – for initial ingestion
  - `stg` – for cleaned and standardized data
  - `dwh` – for dimensional modeling (star schema)

### 3. **Data Cleaning (SQL Server)**
Key cleaning operations:
- Standardized `ORDERDATE` using `TRY_CONVERT(DATE, ORDERDATE)`
- Cleaned phone numbers: removed special characters (`-`, `.`, `(`, `)`, spaces)
- Fixed inconsistent text: `USA` → `United States`, `NYC` → `New York`, etc.
- Applied proper case for names and addresses
- Handled NULLs and invalid entries

### 4. **Star Schema Modeling**
Built in `dwh` schema:
- **Fact Table**: `FactSales` (measures: Sales, Quantity, Price)
- **Dimension Tables**:
  - `DimCustomer`
  - `DimProduct`
  - `DimGeography`
  - `DimDate`

All tables linked via surrogate keys.

### 5. **BI Visualization (Power BI)**
- Connected Power BI to `SalesDW`
- Modeled relationships between fact and dimension tables
- Created key DAX measures:
  - `Total Sales`, `Total Orders`, `Average Sale`, `Total Customers`
- Built interactive dashboard with slicers and drill-down capability

### 6. **Deployment & Documentation**
- Published dashboard to Power BI Service
- All SQL scripts saved in `.sql` files (organized by phase)
- This documentation added to GitHub repo

## 💡 Insights

- **Sales Trend**: Declining sales over time — indicates need for marketing or product review.
- **Top Markets**: United States and Australia are leading contributors to revenue.
- **Product Performance**: Classic Cars and Motorcycles generate the highest sales.
- **Deal Size**: Medium deals dominate volume, but large deals contribute significantly to total revenue.
- **Geographic Spread**: Strong presence across multiple territories, with room for growth in EMEA.

These insights help identify growth opportunities, optimize inventory, and improve customer targeting.
