## üìå Problem Statement

The dataset provided is a single flat file containing sales records with inconsistent, unstructured, and dirty data ‚Äî including missing values, incorrect formats, duplicate entries, and mixed text cases. This makes direct analysis unreliable and inefficient.

**Objective**:  
Build a reliable data pipeline to:
- Clean and structure raw sales data
- Model a star schema for analytical performance
- Enable business intelligence reporting and dashboards
- Support decision-making with accurate, timely insights

This project simulates real-world scenarios faced by data analysts and engineers in retail or e-commerce environments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps Followed

### 1. **Data Acquisition**
- Dataset sourced from Kaggle: [Sample Sales Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyanyoga/sample-sales-data)
- Single CSV file ingested into SQL Server using Import Wizard

### 2. **Database & Schema Design**
- Created database: `SalesDW`
- Implemented layered architecture:
  - `raw` ‚Äì for initial ingestion
  - `stg` ‚Äì for cleaned and standardized data
  - `dwh` ‚Äì for dimensional modeling (star schema)

### 3. **Data Cleaning (SQL Server)**
Key cleaning operations:
- Standardized `ORDERDATE` using `TRY_CONVERT(DATE, ORDERDATE)`
- Cleaned phone numbers: removed special characters (`-`, `.`, `(`, `)`, spaces)
- Fixed inconsistent text: `USA` ‚Üí `United States`, `NYC` ‚Üí `New York`, etc.
- Applied proper case for names and addresses
- Handled NULLs and invalid entries

### 4. **Star Schema Modeling**
Built in `dwh` schema:
- **Fact Table**: `FactSales` (measures: Sales, Quantity, Price)
- **Dimension Tables**:
  - `DimCustomer`
  - `DimProduct`
  - `DimGeography`
  - `DimDate`

All tables linked via surrogate keys.

### 5. **BI Visualization (Power BI)**
- Connected Power BI to `SalesDW`
- Modeled relationships between fact and dimension tables
- Created key DAX measures:
  - `Total Sales`, `Total Orders`, `Average Sale`, `Total Customers`
- Built interactive dashboard with slicers and drill-down capability

### 6. **Deployment & Documentation**
- Published dashboard to Power BI Service
- All SQL scripts saved in `.sql` files (organized by phase)
- This documentation added to GitHub repo

## üí° Insights

- **Sales Trend**: Declining sales over time ‚Äî indicates need for marketing or product review.
- **Top Markets**: United States and Australia are leading contributors to revenue.
- **Product Performance**: Classic Cars and Motorcycles generate the highest sales.
- **Deal Size**: Medium deals dominate volume, but large deals contribute significantly to total revenue.
- **Geographic Spread**: Strong presence across multiple territories, with room for growth in EMEA.

These insights help identify growth opportunities, optimize inventory, and improve customer targeting.

2. Ensure all tables are populated and relationships built
3. Open `Sales_Analysis.pbix` in Power BI Desktop
4. Refresh data or update connection to your SQL Server instance
5. Explore the dashboard
